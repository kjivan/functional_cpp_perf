# Functional C++ Performance Test

## Overview

I created this repo/code to do a quick test of some functional style programming using the algorithms library. I wanted to compare the performance of functionaly style program vs a more iterative approach.

## Prereqs

- g++/clang++ (c++20 support)

## Compile

`clang++ -std=c++20 main.cpp`

## Run application

`./a.out`
